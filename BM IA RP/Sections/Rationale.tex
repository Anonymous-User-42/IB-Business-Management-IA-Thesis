{DDE is a private construction contracting company that supplies and procures labour, material, equipment, and general miscellaneous technical works related to the construction of general structures and buildings. They have an office branch in Al Nahda, Dubai. The business has been showing steady and consistent growth every year. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the whole market has been hit severely, and DDE currently fails to land enough projects in its hand to generate significant revenue to generate a significant Net Profit. Following this, the owner is considering laying off full-time labourers and instead outsourcing them as per demand to reduce operating costs.}
