{The questionnaire displayed overall satisfaction amongst the previous customers and an excellent general opinion of the company amongst the employees. Approximately 65\% of the previous customers are willing to sign a contract again with the company if they can. About 75\% of the previous customers were satisfied with the quality of the company's work.}

{The interview with the company owner showed that the firm is able to meet its goals and objectives at the moment, which he largely gives credit to their small and simple organisational structure without much of a hierarchy in the organisation.}

{The owner states his reasoning to proceed on the initiative (outsourcing labour) as this would enable them to reduce their costs, as the workers (labourers) would be paid on a project basis instead of a monthly basis; also, this move would reduce their fixed cost per blue-collar employee, expenses like health insurance, visas, accommodation etc.}

{This move would also enable them to offer consultants and contractors more competitive prices and possibly lead to more contracts being signed, eventually leading to "wider margins" or "higher profits".}
